## #I've redone this project 2 times and learned so much both times

To start, since it was the first time I'd done such a big level, I created a small space to let me understand what the final level would look like. This "test" level contains all the elements that will be in the final level, but is reduced in size. In this way I understood, thanks to a study and feedback from the team, what was right and what was wrong.
