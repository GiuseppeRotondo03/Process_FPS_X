## #I've redone this project 2 times and learned so much both times

To start, since it was the first time I'd done such a big level, I created a small space to let me understand what the final level would look like. This "test" level contains all the elements that will be in the final level, but is reduced in size. In this way I understood, thanks to a study and feedback from the team, what was right and what was wrong.

## #From the feedback and analysis it emerged that:
- It's too claustrophobic. The player must know where to go, but he must not be forced to follow a path.
- Little light enters, you can see very little
- Too many different colors, little contrast between the background and the props in the ground
- Too many branches, just create unnecessary confusion
- I rely too much on hiding behind logs, I have to leave them as help, not base the level on them
- Enemies are too close together, the player can't play the level stealthily
