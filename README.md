## #I've redone this project 2 times and learned so much both times

To start, since it was the first time I'd done such a big level, I created a small space to let me understand what the final level would look like. This "test" level contains all the elements that will be in the final level, but is reduced in size. In this way I understood, thanks to a study and feedback from the team, what was right and what was wrong.

# #Feedback and fix
## #From the feedback and analysis it emerged that:
- It's too claustrophobic. The player must know where to go, but he must not be forced to follow a path.
- Poor light, hard to see
- Too many different colors, little contrast between the background and the props in the ground
- Too many branches, just create unnecessary confusion
- I rely too much on trunk, I have to leave them as help, not base the level on them
- Enemies are too close together, the player can't play the level stealthily

## #Fix in the new level
- [Claustrophobic] In the new level, I created large spaces where enemies stop to rest, the player feels less oppressed
- [light enters] Made the trees much taller and with the canopy blocking less light, greatly increasing visibility
- [Too many different colors] I decreased the difference of colors and played much more on Black and White. There are now fewer colors, the ground and non-interactable props are dark gray and the background is white. In this way the white of the walls creates contrast and increases the incoming light
- [Too many branches] in the new level they are all covered by a canopy, the only ones not covered are short and have interactable objects on them (birds nests)
- I rely too much on hiding behind logs, in the new level the efficiency of using all the props is significantly increased, so it looks not just a forest but a real outpost
- Enemies are too close together, in the new level there are large spaces where there are enemies, but also small groups of sentries, far from the groups

# #Creation of the new level, process
I started with some big shapes, so that I understood the dimensions of the level, then I created 2 different groups of enemies (the ones around the fire). After having the rocks, I added groups of enemies and changed the placement of both over and over. Finally, I added trees, fallen logs, bushes, crates and birds' nests, and tall grass to help (or not) the player deal with enemies.
